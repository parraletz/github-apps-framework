# Contributing to the GitHub Apps Framework

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether you're fixing a bug, improving documentation, or proposing a new feature, your help is valued. Thank you for your interest in making this framework better.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/your-username/github-apps-framework/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/your-username/github-apps-framework/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Open a new issue to start a discussion about your idea. This allows us to coordinate efforts and ensure the proposed change aligns with the project's goals.

## Making a Pull Request

1.  **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`.
2.  **Set up your development environment** by following the instructions in the `README.md`.
3.  **Make your changes.** Ensure your code follows the existing style and architectural patterns.
4.  **Add or update tests** as necessary to cover your changes. Run `pnpm test` to ensure all tests pass.
5.  **Ensure your code lints.** (Add a linting step in the future if desired).
6.  **Update the documentation** (`README.md` or other relevant files) if your changes affect it.
7.  **Create a pull request** with a clear title and description of your changes. Link to any relevant issues.

## Coding Style

- We use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and follow the configuration in `tsconfig.json`.
- We use `pnpm` for package management.
- Code should be organized into classes and modules as seen in the existing structure (`services`, `config`, etc.).
- Strive for clean, readable, and well-documented code.

Thank you for your contribution!
